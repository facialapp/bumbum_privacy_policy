    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how TouShih Technology Ltd collects, uses, shares, and stores your information when

    <ol type="a">
      <li>
        <strong>How old do I have to be to consent to you using my data?</strong><br>
        You can&rsquo;t use TouShih Technology Ltd if you are younger than 13. In almost all countries, if you are 13
        and over, you can allow us to use your data.<br>
        But, since the law changed in Europe, in some European countries, we need to ask for your parent&rsquo;s or
        guardian&rsquo;s consent before we let you create an account if you are between 13 and 16 years old.<br>
        This is called the &ldquo;age of consent&rdquo;, and it means that if you are under a certain age, we need to
        get a parental consent. The age varies across different European countries, so it depends on where you live.<br>
        If you live in the UK, Ireland, Latvia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Poland, Spain or Sweden, we won&rsquo;t need to
        ask for that extra consent from grownups.<br>
        If you live in Slovakia, Germany, Hungary, Lithuania, Luxembourg or Netherlands and are aged under 16, you
        confirm that you have your parent&rsquo;s consent to sign up to TouShih Technology Ltd and we will take all
        reasonable steps to verify this.<br>
        If you live in France and are aged under 15, you confirm that you have your parent&rsquo;s consent to sign up to
        TouShih Technology Ltd and we will take all reasonable steps to verify this.<br>
        If you live in Austria and are aged under 14, you confirm that you have your parent&rsquo;s consent to sign up
        to TouShih Technology Ltd and we will take all reasonable steps to verify this.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li><strong>How do you collect my data?</strong><br>
        How we collect, process and store information depends in part on how you use the Services. You may register to
        use the Services (&ldquo;Registered User&rdquo;). You can use some of the Services without creating an account
        (&ldquo;Guest User&rdquo;) or providing any information other than information that is automatically collected
        as explained below. The different categories of information we collect from you are described below.<br>
        <br></li>
      <li>
        <strong> What data do you collect about me?</strong><br>
        We may collect information from you during your use of the Services, including your name, username, password,
        e-mail address, postal address, phone number, mobile phone number, payment information, gender, birth year, and
        other information you provide or post on our Services or allow us to access when you do certain things, such as:
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Do you collect data about my location?</strong><br>
        We may collect general information (e.g. IP address, zip code) about your location, and may use that information
        to customize the Services with location-based information, advertising, and features that need to know your
        location to work properly. By accessing and using the Services, you consent to this collection and processing of
        location information. If you choose to turn off location services on your device, some features may not be
        available to you.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>How do I stop receiving anonymous messages or unregistered questions?</strong><br>
        Some people don&rsquo;t like receiving things from people if they don&rsquo;t know who they are. So we provide
        all users with the ability to choose not to receive questions from anonymous users on the &ldquo;Settings&rdquo;
        page on the website and mobile application.<br>
        If you do choose to allow anonymous messages, please know that our intention is that they will foster candid,
        open conversations. However, if someone does abuse the option of being anonymous through inappropriate
        communications that violate our Terms of Use because they know you don&rsquo;t know who they are, you have the
        ability to report that user to us so that we may take appropriate action. We have also built-in site moderation
        techniques to protect you and to prevent users from transmitting harmful content. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>How can I block other users?</strong><br>
        You have the ability to add any user to your &ldquo;blocklist&rdquo; at any time by clicking on the
        &ldquo;block&rdquo; button on that user&rsquo;s profile. This will prevent the user from asking you a
        question.<br>
